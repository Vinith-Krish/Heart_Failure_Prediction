# Heart_Failure_Prediction Using Explainable AI
This Project introduces a resourceful criterion for heart failure prediction by integrating machine learning, hyperparameter tuning, and explainable artificial intelligence(XAI) techniques. Through a comparative analysis, the bagging algorithm, especially Random Forest Classifier exhibits exceptional effectiveness in accurately recognizing heart failure. The iterative hyperparameter tuning process enhances the final  Random Forest Classifier model’s accuracy to an impressive 88.04%. The incorporation of XAI methods such as SHAP values and LIME, provides a subtle understanding of feature importance and individual predictions, elevating model readability. This research’s significance lies in its latent to overcome the heart failure rate. The union of machine learning classifiers, hyperparameter tuning, and XAI techniques contributes to determining whether or not a person suffers from heart failure, cultivating trust among clinicians and researchers.
